## New Item to Analyze

**Source**: github (issue)
**Title**: Implement payment authentication flow
**URL**: https://github.com/acme/app/issues/456

**Description**:
We need to add user authentication to the payment checkout flow before users can proceed to payment. This should implement the security requirements discussed in the team meeting and align with the authentication UI designs that were approved last week. The backend API needs to validate user sessions before allowing access to the payment page.

**Metadata**:
```json
{
  "repository": "acme/app",
  "number": 456,
  "labels": ["feature", "authentication", "payment"],
  "state": "open"
}
```

## Your Task

Analyze if the **new item** (GitHub issue #456) is related to any of the **existing items**.

Look for these relationship types:
1. **implements** - The new item implements/completes another item (e.g., PR implements Linear issue)
2. **references** - The new item references another (e.g., design referenced in code)
3. **blocks** - The new item blocks another from progress
4. **relates_to** - General relationship
5. **deploys** - Code deployment related to feature

For each relationship found, provide:
- Target item ID
- Relationship type
- Confidence (0.0 - 1.0)
- Brief reasoning

**Output Format** (save to `.claude-analysis/results/test-rel-demo.json`):
```json
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "targetItemId": "item-id-here",
      "relationshipType": "implements",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
    }
  ],
  "shouldCreateThread": true,
  "suggestedThread": {
    "title": "Thread title",
    "description": "Thread description",
    "confidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

Only include relationships with confidence > 0.5.
Set `shouldCreateThread: true` if 2+ high-confidence relationships found.
