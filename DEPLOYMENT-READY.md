```

### Generate CRON_SECRET
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

**Why Vercel**:
- Built-in cron job support (via `vercel.json`)
- Automatic deployments on git push
- Edge functions for fast global performance
- Free tier includes everything we need

**Steps**:

1. **Connect Repository**:
```bash
# If you haven't already, push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
```

2. **Import to Vercel**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will detect Next.js automatically

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all required variables (see above)
   - Set for Production, Preview, and Development

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically:
     - Run `npm install`
     - Run `prisma generate`
     - Run `npm run build`
     - Deploy to production
     - Set up cron job from `vercel.json`

5. **Verify Deployment**:
```bash
# Test cron job endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/daily-digest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-CRON_SECRET>"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed": 0,
  "sent": 0,
  "failed": 0,
  "skipped": 0,
  "message": "Successfully sent 0 digests"
}
```

### Option 2: Railway

**Why Railway**:
- Built-in PostgreSQL database
- Environment variable management
- Easy cron job setup

**Steps**:

1. **Connect Repository**:
```bash
railway login
railway link
```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
```bash
railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxx
railway variables set CRON_SECRET=<your-secret>
railway variables set LOG_DIGEST_RUNS=true
```

3. **Set up Cron Job**:
   - Railway supports cron via services
   - Add to `railway.toml`:
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run build && npm start"

[[crons]]
schedule = "0 * * * *"
command = "curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/daily-digest -H 'Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET'"
```

4. **Deploy**:
```bash
railway up
```

### Option 3: Docker + Any Platform

**Why Docker**:
- Portable across any platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- Consistent environment

**Create Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npx prisma generate
RUN npm run build

# Production image
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**Build & Deploy**:
```bash
docker build -t synapse .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=... \
  -e RESEND_API_KEY=... \
  -e CRON_SECRET=... \
  synapse
```

## 📈 Analytics to Set Up (Post-Deployment)

### Mixpanel/Segment Events

Add these tracking events to measure impact:

```javascript
// Week 1 Metrics
analytics.track('empty_state_viewed', { type: 'templates' });
analytics.track('template_clicked', { template_id: 'feature-launch' });
analytics.track('first_thread_created', { from_template: true });

// Week 2 Metrics
analytics.track('onboarding_step_viewed', { step: 'welcome' });
analytics.track('onboarding_step_completed', { step: 'welcome', time_spent_seconds: 20 });
analytics.track('onboarding_completed', { total_time_seconds: 70 });

// Week 3 Metrics
analytics.track('aha_moment_viewed', { integration: 'linear', opportunities: 3 });
analytics.track('thread_created_from_opportunity', { opportunity_id: 'linear-1' });
analytics.track('digest_email_sent', { user_id, has_alerts: true });
analytics.track('digest_email_opened', { user_id });
analytics.track('command_palette_opened');
analytics.track('integration_connected', { integration: 'github', source: 'prompt' });
```

### Conversion Funnel

Set up funnel tracking:
```
Signup → Onboarding Started → Role Selected → Integration Connected →
Aha Moment Viewed → First Thread Created → Week-1 Active
```

### Goal: Measure Against Predictions

| Metric | Baseline | Predicted | Measure |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Onboarding Completion | 23% | 73% | Track in Mixpanel |
| Time to Complete | 10 min | 70 sec | Event timestamps |
| First Thread Creation | 12% | 80% | Conversion funnel |
| Week-1 Retention | 45% | 80% | Cohort analysis |
| Multi-Integration Usage | 20% | 80% | Integration count |
| Cmd+K DAU | 0% | 30% | Daily active users |

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Blocking Issues

1. **Clerk/React Warnings** (Build):
   - Warning: `useContext is not exported from 'react'`
   - Cause: Clerk compatibility with Next.js 15
   - Impact: None (warning only, no runtime issues)
   - Solution: Will resolve when Clerk updates for Next.js 15

2. **Mock Data** (Temporary):
   - Aha Moment uses mock thread detection
   - Daily digest uses mock user/thread data
   - Integration prompts use hardcoded user integrations
   - Solution: Wire up real API calls in Phase 2

3. **OAuth Flows** (Incomplete):
   - Integration connection buttons don't trigger real OAuth
   - Need to implement OAuth handlers for each integration
   - Solution: Add OAuth flows in separate PR

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

- Real integration data fetching
- Complete OAuth implementation
- Email preferences UI (settings page)
- A/B testing framework
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Public API for third-party integrations
