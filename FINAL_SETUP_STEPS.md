### STEP 1: Disable Deployment Protection (2 minutes)

Your app is fully deployed with all environment variables configured! However, you might still see a 401 Unauthorized error due to Vercel's deployment protection.

**To fix this:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/sheshanks-projects-5275d9db/synpase/settings/deployment-protection

2. Change the setting to:
   - **"Only Preview Deployments"** (keeps protection on previews but not production)
   - OR **"None"** (removes all protection)

3. Click **Save**

That's it! Your production URL will now be publicly accessible.

## Your Production URL:

**https://synpase-nzke2dlyi-sheshanks-projects-5275d9db.vercel.app**

(Note: This will only work fully after you disable deployment protection above)

---

## Testing Your Setup:

Once you've disabled deployment protection:

1. Visit: https://synpase-nzke2dlyi-sheshanks-projects-5275d9db.vercel.app
2. Login with Clerk
3. Go to Integrations ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Connect
4. Select your repositories
5. Enable automation
6. Create a test GitHub issue
7. Check your Synapse dashboard - a thread should auto-create!
