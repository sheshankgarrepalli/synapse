# ðŸ”“ Fix 401 Unauthorized Error

## Problem:
Your Vercel deployment is returning **401 Unauthorized** because **Deployment Protection** is enabled.

## Solution: Disable Deployment Protection

### Step 1: Disable Protection in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/sheshanks-projects-5275d9db/synpase/settings/deployment-protection**

2. You'll see "Deployment Protection" settings with options like:
   - Standard Protection
   - Vercel Authentication
   - Password Protection

3. **Change it to:**
   - Select **"Only Preview Deployments"** (keeps protection on previews but not production)
   - OR select **"None"** (removes all protection)

4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Redeploy

After changing the setting, redeploy:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test

Your production URL will now be publicly accessible:

**https://synpase-pfgh6gx2c-sheshanks-projects-5275d9db.vercel.app**

## Why This Happened:

Vercel's free tier enables "Deployment Protection" by default on personal projects to prevent unauthorized access. This is great for private projects, but for a public web app that needs to be accessible without login, you need to disable it.

---

## After Fixing:

Once the 401 error is fixed:

1. âœ… Your app will be publicly accessible
2. âœ… You can proceed with adding environment variables
3. âœ… GitHub webhooks will work properly
4. âœ… Users can login with Clerk without Vercel authentication

## Alternative: Keep Protection and Use a Custom Domain

If you want to keep protection for the auto-generated URLs but have a public URL:

1. Add a custom domain in Vercel (requires domain ownership)
2. The custom domain won't have protection enabled by default
3. This is the best option for production apps
