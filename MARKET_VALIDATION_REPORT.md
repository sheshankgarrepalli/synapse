## 6. Feature Validation

### What Features Actually Matter? (Based on competitor analysis)

**Must-Have Features (All 3 competitors have these):**
1. ✅ Automated screenshot capture
2. ✅ Baseline comparison (before/after)
3. ✅ Visual change highlighting
4. ✅ CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
5. ✅ Browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
6. ✅ Team collaboration (comments, approvals)
7. ✅ Unlimited users

**Nice-to-Have Features (Differentiation opportunities):**
1. Storybook integration (Chromatic's strength)
2. AI-powered analysis (Applitools' strength)
3. Accessibility testing (Chromatic has this)
4. Self-healing tests (Applitools' strength)
5. Component-level testing (Chromatic + Applitools)

**Our MVP Should Focus On:**
1. Figma → GitHub integration (competitors don't emphasize Figma)
2. Design-specific property tracking (colors, spacing, fonts)
3. Slack alerts (simpler than dashboard-only)
4. Linear/Jira ticket creation (automation competitors lack)

**Differentiation Opportunity:** ⭐ **Figma-first approach** ⭐
- Competitors focus on code-to-code visual testing
- We focus on design-to-code drift detection
- Gap in market: designers updating Figma AFTER coding starts

**Validation Signal:** Clear differentiation path identified ✅

---

## 7. Market Entry Opportunity

### Why Now? Why Us?

**Market Gaps Identified:**

1. **Figma-first approach missing:**
   - Percy, Chromatic, Applitools test code vs code
   - No one tests Figma vs code directly
   - Designers update Figma constantly (version control problem)

2. **Pricing gap for startups:**
   - Applitools: $699-$969/mo (too expensive)
   - Chromatic: $179/mo (affordable but limited to Storybook)
   - Gap: $300-500/mo for Figma-focused teams

3. **Integration gap:**
   - Competitors require Storybook setup (barrier to entry)
   - We can integrate directly: Figma + GitHub + Slack
   - Simpler onboarding for design-heavy teams

4. **Alert fatigue:**
   - Competitors require dashboard checking
   - We push alerts proactively (Slack, Linear)
   - Prevent drift before implementation vs catch after

**Validation Signal:** Clear market entry opportunities ✅

- **Mitigation:** Proven price points of $179-$969/month
- **Validation:** Enterprise customers already paying hundreds monthly

**Risk 4: Technical Complexity**
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Use existing APIs (Figma, GitHub)
- **Validation:** Competitors have proven it's technically feasible

**Risk 5: Customer Acquisition**
- **Risk Level:** High (your stated challenge)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with Product Hunt launch
  - Target design communities (Designer News, Figma community)
  - Offer 30-day free trial (copy Linear's strategy)
  - Build in public on Twitter
- **Validation:** Competitors acquired customers (you can too)
