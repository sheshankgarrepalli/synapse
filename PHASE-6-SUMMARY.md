## Animation Behavior

### Shimmer Flow
- Moves continuously along connection lines
- Golden gradient (transparent → bright → transparent)
- Creates sense of data flowing through connections
- 2-second loop, seamless infinite

### Node Pulse
- Active nodes expand and contract subtly
- Shadow grows and shrinks
- Scale: 1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0
- Creates "breathing" effect

### Glow Effects
- Soft golden glow around connected elements
- Intensity varies based on status
- Stronger on hover
- Premium, sophisticated feel

---

## Usage Pattern

```tsx
import {
  ThreadTimeline,
  ThreadConnections,
  ThreadFlowDiagram,
  ThreadStatus,
} from '@/components/visualization';

// Timeline
<ThreadTimeline activities={activities} />

// Connections
<ThreadConnections integrations={integrations} />
<ThreadStatus status="healthy" />

// Flow Diagram
<ThreadFlowDiagram
  nodes={nodes}
  connections={connections}
  onNodeClick={handleClick}
/>
```

## What Makes This Special

### 1. The Golden Threads Concept Visualized
This is not just decoration - it's the core brand identity made tangible. The animated golden lines represent the actual connections between your tools, flowing with data and activity.

### 2. Premium Execution
Every detail is polished:
- Gradient colors carefully chosen
- Animations timed perfectly
- Spacing follows 8px grid
- Shadows create depth

### 3. Purposeful Animation
Unlike many apps that add animation for flash, every animation here serves a purpose:
- Shimmer shows active data flow
- Pulse indicates current activity
- Glow highlights connections
- Movement draws attention appropriately

### 4. Enterprise-Grade Polish
Built to impress:
- Sophisticated visual language
- Professional appearance
- Smooth performance
- Attention to detail
