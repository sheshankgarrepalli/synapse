## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: API Rate Limit Exhaustion**
- **Impact:** Figma's 6,000 credits/min shared across all customers could bottleneck
- **Mitigation:** Implement Redis-based distributed rate limiter, queue requests with exponential backoff, monitor per-tenant usage, throttle heavy users

**Risk 2: OAuth Integration Breaks**
- **Impact:** Figma/Linear/GitHub API changes could break integrations
- **Mitigation:** Versioned API clients, automated integration tests daily, fallback to polling if webhooks fail, maintain 2 versions of each integration

**Risk 3: Database Performance Degradation**
- **Impact:** Slow queries as data grows could frustrate users
- **Mitigation:** Index optimization from day 1, pg_stat_statements monitoring, connection pooling, shard by tenant_id if needed at scale

**Risk 4: Real-time Sync Latency**
- **Impact:** Stale data or sync lag frustrates collaborative workflows
- **Mitigation:** WebSocket fallback to polling, optimistic UI updates, client-side CRDT conflict resolution, Redis pub/sub for multi-node sync

### Business Risks

**Risk 5: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion**
- **Impact:** Free tier users never upgrade = unsustainable unit economics
- **Mitigation:** Limit free tier to 5 threads (hit within 2 weeks), prominent upgrade CTAs, value demonstration with "time saved" metrics

**Risk 6: High Churn After Initial Activation**
- **Impact:** Users try for 1 week then abandon = wasted CAC spend
- **Mitigation:** Email drip campaign, success dashboard showing value, customer success check-ins for Professional+ plans

**Risk 7: Customer Support Overwhelm**
- **Impact:** Solo founder can't handle support volume at 500+ users
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive docs and help center, community Slack for peer support, hire first support engineer at $5K MRR

**Risk 8: Budget Overrun (>$500/month)**
- **Impact:** Infrastructure costs spike unexpectedly, threatening sustainability
- **Mitigation:** Usage-based pricing tiers, automated alerts at 80% budget, prepaid infrastructure credits, optimize expensive AI calls

### Market Risks

**Risk 9: Figma Builds Competing Feature**
- **Impact:** Figma adds native "project threads" connecting to GitHub/Linear
- **Mitigation:** Focus on 8-tool breadth (not just Figma-centric), emphasize AI features Figma won't build, faster iteration speed

**Risk 10: Slow Integration Adoption**
- **Impact:** Users only connect 1-2 tools, missing full value of Golden Threads
- **Mitigation:** Onboarding checklist requiring 3+ tools, template library showing multi-tool examples, "Connect Figma" persistent banner

**Risk 11: Enterprise Sales Require SOC 2 Too Soon**
- **Impact:** Need to spend $50K on SOC 2 before revenue justifies it
- **Mitigation:** Target SMB segment first (less compliance requirements), document security practices thoroughly, wait until 10+ enterprise prospects demand it

## CONCLUSION

Synapse addresses a $450 billion annual productivity loss through a purpose-built integration platform that preserves complete product development context across eight essential tools. By introducing Golden Threads—persistent, intelligent connections from user research through deployed code—we eliminate the context switching tax that costs design teams 20-40% of their productive time.

**Our unfair advantages:**
1. **Timing:** 2025 infrastructure economics enable enterprise-grade product on $500/month budget
2. **Focus:** Purpose-built for design/product workflows, not generic iPaaS
3. **Context:** Only platform connecting entire product lifecycle, not just design→dev handoff
4. **AI-Native:** Semantic search and automation purpose-built for creative workflows

**3-Month Launch Targets:**
- 2,500 signups, 1,000 activated users, 200 paying organizations
- $15,000 MRR with 70% gross margins
- 10% market penetration in target segment (small agencies + startup product teams)
- Production-grade platform with enterprise security, not MVP

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin technical implementation using accompanying Technical Specification Document
2. Set up infrastructure (Railway, Supabase, Cloudflare R2) - Week 1
3. Implement Tier 1 integrations (GitHub, Slack, Linear) - Weeks 2-3
4. Build Golden Thread core functionality - Week 4
5. Complete all features through Week 12 launch

This is not an MVP—this is a production-ready, enterprise-grade platform that will redefine how design and product teams maintain context across their toolchains. Let's build it.
