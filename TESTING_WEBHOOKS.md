# Testing GitHub Webhook Automation

## Overview

This guide will help you test that your GitHub webhook automation is working correctly from end to end.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. ‚úÖ Localtunnel or ngrok running
2. ‚úÖ Dev server running
3. ‚úÖ GitHub OAuth connected
4. ‚úÖ At least one repository selected with webhook enabled
5. ‚úÖ At least one automation created

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup

Check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
# Check your .env file
grep NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL .env
grep GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET .env

# Ensure localtunnel is running
# You should see: "your url is: https://xxx.loca.lt"
```

Expected output:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://chilly-grapes-beam.loca.lt"
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="020b82d2c4c440ceaf309f56a87cd4075dd5d0dee396ad57bb343aec3c75dd6d"
```

### Step 2: Check What's Connected

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/integrations/github/repositories
2. Verify you see repositories with "Automated" badge
3. Note which repository has automation enabled

### Step 3: Check Your Automation Rules

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/automations
2. You should see at least one automation rule
3. Check the automation details:
   - **Trigger**: Should be "GitHub Issue" or "GitHub PR"
   - **Action**: Should be "opened" (or whatever you configured)
   - **Status**: Should show as "Active"

### Step 4: Create a Test GitHub Issue

Now let's trigger the automation by creating a GitHub issue.

**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface**

1. Go to the repository that has automation enabled
2. Click "Issues" tab
3. Click "New Issue"
4. Enter:
   - Title: "Test webhook automation"
   - Body: "Testing if Synapse automation creates a thread automatically"
5. Click "Submit new issue"

**Option B: Using GitHub CLI**

```bash
# Replace OWNER/REPO with your repository
gh issue create \
  --title "Test webhook automation" \
  --body "Testing if Synapse automation creates a thread automatically" \
  --repo OWNER/REPO
```

### Step 5: Watch the Server Logs

After creating the issue, watch your dev server terminal. You should see logs like:

```
üîî GitHub webhook received: {
  method: 'POST',
  event: 'issues',
  delivery: '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc'
}
üì¶ Webhook payload received: { event: 'issues', hasSignature: true, payloadSize: 15234 }
‚úÖ Webhook signature verified
üìù Handling issues event: opened
üîç Looking for automations for issue event: {
  action: 'opened',
  repository: 'yourname/your-repo',
  issue: '#1'
}
üìã Found 1 active automations for github.issue
üîé Checking automation "Create thread from GitHub issues" {
  automationId: 'abc123...',
  triggerAction: 'opened',
  actualAction: 'opened',
  repoFilter: 'yourname/your-repo',
  actualRepo: 'yourname/your-repo'
}
‚úÖ Automation "Create thread from GitHub issues" matches! Executing...
üßµ Creating thread: {
  title: 'yourname/your-repo#1: Test webhook automation',
  status: 'planning',
  organizationId: 'xyz789...'
}
‚úÖ Thread created successfully: {
  threadId: 'thread123...',
  title: 'yourname/your-repo#1: Test webhook automation'
}
‚úÖ Automation "Create thread from GitHub issues" executed successfully
‚úÖ Finished processing issue event (1 automations checked)
‚úÖ Webhook processed successfully
```

### Step 6: Verify Thread Created

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/threads
2. You should see a new thread with title: "yourname/your-repo#1: Test webhook automation"
3. Click on the thread to see details
4. The thread should have:
   - The issue description as the thread description
   - A connected item linking to the GitHub issue
   - Status: "Planning" (or whatever you configured)

### Step 7: Verify in Activity Feed

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/activity (if available)
2. You should see an activity log entry showing the thread was created by automation

## Troubleshooting

### No Webhook Logs Appearing

**Problem**: You created an issue but see no webhook logs in your dev server.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Localtunnel not running**
   ```bash
   # Check if localtunnel is still running
   # You should see it in another terminal
   npx localtunnel --port 3000
   ```

2. **Webhook URL mismatch**
   - The webhook was created with a different URL than your current localtunnel URL
   - **Solution**: Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Edit webhook ‚Üí Update URL

3. **GitHub webhook delivery failed**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click on the Synapse webhook
   - Check "Recent Deliveries"
   - Look for failed deliveries (red X)
   - Click on a failed delivery to see the error message

### Logs Show "Found 0 active automations"

**Problem**: Webhook received but no automations found.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **No automation created**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/automations
   - If empty, you need to create an automation

2. **Automation is inactive**
   - Check automation status in the UI
   - Ensure it's active (not paused)

3. **Trigger type mismatch**
   - Check automation trigger matches the event you're testing
   - For issue creation, trigger should be "GitHub Issue" with action "opened"

### Logs Show "Skipping: action mismatch"

**Problem**: Automation found but action doesn't match.

**Example Log**:
```
üîé Checking automation "My Automation" {
  triggerAction: 'closed',
  actualAction: 'opened',
  ...
}
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping: action mismatch (expected closed, got opened)
```

**Solution**: Your automation is configured for "closed" issues but you created an "opened" issue.

**Fix**: Either:
- Create an automation with action "opened"
- Close the issue to trigger the "closed" automation

### Logs Show "Skipping: repository mismatch"

**Problem**: Automation found but repository doesn't match.

**Example Log**:
```
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping: repository mismatch (expected owner/repo-a, got owner/repo-b)
```

**Solution**: You created an issue in `owner/repo-b` but the automation is configured for `owner/repo-a`.

**Fix**: Either:
- Create the issue in the correct repository (`owner/repo-a`)
- Update the automation to match `owner/repo-b`
- Remove repository filter from automation (to match all repos)

### Webhook Signature Verification Failed

**Problem**: Logs show "Invalid GitHub webhook signature"

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Webhook secret mismatch**
   - The secret in your `.env` doesn't match the secret configured in GitHub webhook

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check your webhook secret
grep GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET .env

# Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Edit webhook
# Update the "Secret" field to match your .env file
# Click "Update webhook"
```

### Localtunnel Shows "Warning: connection throttled"

**Problem**: Localtunnel is rate limiting requests.

**Solution**: This is normal for localtunnel free tier. Wait a moment and try again. Or:
- Use ngrok instead (requires signup but more reliable)
- Use ngrok Pro for guaranteed uptime

2. Create GitHub issue
3. Verify thread appears in Synapse

### Scenario 2: Test PR Creation ‚Üí Thread Creation

1. Create automation: Trigger "GitHub Pull Request" ‚Üí Action "opened" ‚Üí Create Thread
2. Create GitHub PR
3. Verify thread appears in Synapse

### Scenario 3: Test Issue Closure ‚Üí Update Thread

1. Create automation: Trigger "GitHub Issue" ‚Üí Action "closed" ‚Üí Update Thread (status: "completed")
2. Create and then close a GitHub issue
3. Verify thread status updates to "completed"

## Manual Webhook Testing

You can also manually test the webhook endpoint without creating real GitHub issues.

### Using curl

```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: issues" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=test" \
  -d '{
    "action": "opened",
    "issue": {
      "number": 999,
      "title": "Manual Test Issue",
      "body": "This is a manual test",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/test/test/issues/999",
      "state": "open",
      "labels": []
    },
    "repository": {
      "full_name": "yourname/your-repo",
      "name": "your-repo"
    }
  }'
```

**Note**: This will fail signature verification unless you:
1. Generate the correct HMAC signature, OR
2. Temporarily disable signature verification for testing

### Using GitHub's Webhook Test

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Click on Synapse webhook
3. Scroll to "Recent Deliveries"
4. Click "Redeliver" on any previous delivery
5. This will resend the webhook event
